            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Could heartily wiſh, that our Condition at preſent were ſuch, that we might ſtudy and debate how to advance the Glory, Riches and Power of this Nation, rather than with ſo much Diſtraction, labour how to preſerve its Being. But ſince the general ill Conduct of our Affairs under the late Chancellor &amp; others, (for whom we ought to retain all due reſentments, ſince they have reduced us to this neceſſitous paſture;) Let us conſider what our preſent Exigencies call for from us; and while therein we find a juſtification for the moſt extravagant debates and reſolutions, let us continue ſenſible of their baſeneſs who created the neceſſity, with which it is our prudence and unhappineſs to comply.</p>
            <p>There have been ſundry Overtures and Projects in order to the Uniting of the minds of the Proteſtants here in this dangerous juncture of Affairs: I confeſs I am apprehenſive of the dangers that any great change ſubjects a Government unto; I am ſenſible of the Reputation of the Houſe, which may ſuffer by reſcinding its own Acts: I have made ſome reflections upon the parties that may endanger the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by their factiouſneſs: I have all juſt reſpect for the National Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in its preſent Conſtitution; and I ſhall ſo order my Counſels, that I deviate not from the Scripture, and the Conſtitution of God in the Moſaical Law, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Practice of the primitive Fathers, and the Acts and Conſtitutions of thoſe Emperours who firſt modelled Chriſtianity, and accommodated it to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and who reduced the Empire (in circumſtances not much different from ours) to as flouriſhing a condition, and as peaceable as ever it enjoyed<note n="*" place="bottom">As is clear from the Emperor <hi>I<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>In the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (that great Preſident for Monarchy, as far as it is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Word of God) where God himſelf was Law giver, and the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is as unqueſtionable as his Authority that made it, and the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> and ſome others (no Fools, nor Fanaticks) that complyed with it. The Settlement was thus as to Religion. The Jews, and ſuch as were total Converts or Proſelites of Juſtice, did obſerve all the Levitical Law, as it is made up of Ceremonies, and all the Decalogue or Ten Commandments. What the ceremonial Conformity was you all know: and how much of it was performed in the Temple, in the ſeveral places or ſtations for the Prieſts, and Laity, Men and Women: But did this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution oblige all? Could no man, or number of men live, and live openly there exempted from this Conformity, and exact Uniformity to every punctilic? It is undeniable that it was quite otherwiſe. There were among the Jews a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons called <hi>proſelyti domicilii,</hi> or ſtrangers, not Proſelytes of Juſtice, that dwelt conſtantly among them, that were ſo far from being concluded by the Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law, that it was death for them to obſerve it. Of this number were many <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> that came up with them into the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> Such were the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> of whoſe number we may gueſs by the bigneſs of their City: Such were the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> that dwelt in the Land, whoſe power was ſuch, that they could not be exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> All theſe ſtrangers (yet conſtant Inhabitants of the Land) were only obliged to the ſeven Commandments of <hi>Noah,</hi> and not to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law at all. They worſhipped in the ſame Temple, in a particular apartment, but with different Ceremonies: the Jews had a Liturgy, theſe no Form: they had Prieſts, theſe none: the Jews offered variety of Sacrifices and Oblations, theſe none but burnt Offerings: the one obſerved the Sabbath, and divers Holy days, on the which the other might work; nay, the one worſhipped God under ſeveral Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> the other was not obliged actually to any worſhip, but negatively not to deny a Deity, or to ſpeak irreverently or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104333:2"/>contumeliouſly of him: and when they did pray, it was only the owning and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping a Creator and Ruler of the World. <hi>This is avowed by the greateſt of the</hi> Rabbines <hi>from the time of</hi> Moſes, <hi>to the time of his writing, and that is</hi> Maimonides:<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Gentilis qui legem <hi>Moſaicam</hi> obſervaret, reus erat mortis; quippe cui tantum obſervanda erant ſeptem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta <hi>Noachidarum,</hi> ſeis omnium hominum communia.</note>

            <p>It is eaſie to compare this Liberty of Religion, with ours in <hi>England,</hi> as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, or oppoſed: and according to judge of the extent of a Toleration, how far it may go, how publick it may be, how poſſible, and how practicable the thing is in it ſelf (for they had no ſtanding Army; and it was under a Monarchy, and that no deſpicable one, under <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>David</hi>) and how it had God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for its eſtabliſher. I paſs by the times under <hi>Herod</hi> and his immediate prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors from <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> downwards, in which, beſide the aforeſaid ſtrangers, there were the ſeveral Sects of Scribes, Phariſees, Sadduces, and Herodians, whoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets if any ſhall enquire into, he ſhall find them to differ as much as our ſubdivided Chriſtians and Proteſtants do:<note n="(f)" place="bottom">As <hi>Scaliger, Druſus,</hi> and <hi>Serrarlus</hi> evidence.</note> As to the Eſſenes, it is peculiarly obſervable that they declin'd the Temple-worſhip, and were the Separatiſts of that Age: and yet I muſt tell you, this condition of the Jews was not altogether unhappy, and our Saviour never told the Magiſtrates that it was unlawful, or that it would be the ruine of the ſtate; which cannot be otherwiſe than by accident imputed thereunto.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt Chriſtians, while thoſe unerring Guides of the Church inſtructed and ruled in the Church, and were as well the foundation of our Doctrine, as of our Hierarchy: let us take a view of their Eſtabliſhment. There were Converts of the Jews, and Converts of the Gentiles, and of the Gentiles ſome were Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes of the Moſaical Law, others of the profeſſion only of the Seven Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Noah.</hi> The Jews, and ſuch as did Judaiſe, obſerved all the Moſaical Law, as ſtrictly as the Phariſees did; they did circumciſe, and pay their Vows, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Temple, and offer Sacrifice, and keep the Sabbath, and the like: <hi>So</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Judaei qui in Jeſum Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam credid<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

It is true, ſome went about to reduce them all to Uniformity; but who were they? Some of the Jews (mark that) which believed (in Chriſt,<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Some Bibles only ſay they were Phariſees.</note> and yet ſtrictly obſerved the Moſaical Law) of the Sect of the Phariſees, (a Sect ſo much decry'd by Chriſt) not the Apoſtles, and perſons ſpirited by the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> oppoſed it.

               <hi>to the Roman Senate;</hi> the particular paſſages I would willingly recite, were there not, beſide protracting this Diſcourſe, a great deal of pedantry in quoting La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin: And I ſhould be too tedious, ſhould I relate unto you all the Edicts made to this purpoſe by the ſubſequent Emperours, which are Recorded in the <hi>Theodoſian Code.</hi> No learned Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> can deny it; <hi>And</hi> Chryſoſtome <hi>is poſitive, that no godly Emperor did Enact againſt the Pagans and ſuch Laws, as they did againſt the Chriſtians.</hi> No man verſed in Antiquity can deny but that all the Sects of the Chriſtians, the Pagans, and the Jews, had a full Liberty of Conſcience and Religion, without being excluded from publick Offices of Truſt and Profit in the Senate, Army and Court. So that theſe times which our Epiſcopal Divines ſo much recommend unto our imitation, when their Hierarchy is concerned, and their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, theſe times do clearly aſſert the lawfulneſs of a General Liberty of Conſcience, without ſubjecting the ſeveral Diſſenters to any penalties.

Nor need they trouble themſelves to object, that the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> had a ſtanding Army to preſerve the Peace and Authority of the <hi>Empire;</hi> ſeeing that thoſe of that Army were diverſify'd by their ſeveral Religions: And it is all one not to have any Army at all, or to have one compoſed indifferently of the ſeveral Parties that were to be kept under.</p>
            <p>Having thus laid before you the judgment and practiſe of the beſt times; it will not be amiſs to reflect upon the ſeveral ways and endeavours have been uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the uniting the minds of men about Religion.</p>
            <p>As to the Popiſh way of inforcing a general Uniformity, it is ſo barbarous, ſo unchriſtian, and ſo generally rejected by Proteſtants, that I believe you cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure an harangue in the behalf of the Inquiſition: and to extol the practices of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days were as abſurd, as to write an <hi>Encomium</hi> for <hi>Phalaris,</hi> or <hi>Buſiris,</hi> or <hi>Nero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another way of Uniting them hath been by contriving general forms and ways, (not much unlike the Device of Comprehenſion, if I underſtand it aright) to which each party might ſubſcribe: but this way God never bleſſed, but it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like the fire-brands, which (with the cords) united the tails of <hi>Sampſons</hi> foxes, while their heads were at diſtance; and being put into the corn, they burnt it; as this method hath ſet all Kingdoms on fire. Nor is it Policy; for inſtead of abrogating all, it gives a countenance to all opinions it would extinguiſh. How
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104333:3"/>little are the controverſies ceaſed between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> ſince the equivocal Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to which they ſubſcribe; and which both parties al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? So among Proteſtants, how little are controverſies extinguiſhed by the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious or general texts of Scripture? nay, are they not eterniſed by them? how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doth the dubious Creed of the Apoſtles conduce to the deciding among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants or <hi>Socinians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the uniting therefore of mens minds into one Religion, it is impoſſible; it is as impoſſible to make all mens conſciences of the ſame extent and latitude, as to make all mens ſhooes of the ſame ſize. Different gifts makes different profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: ſince none is accountable for more than he hath received. The weak are not to condemn the ſtrong; and the ſtrong are to tollerate, not deſtroy the weak. This is Goſpel: and I hope you will make this to be Law. Take away the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the one, and the oppreſſion of the other, and you will eſtabliſh the Church, rather than deſtroy it, or the peace of this Nation. Beſides,</p>
            <p>I deſire you would obſerve, that there is no preſident of any Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience granted on penalties: for that unavoidably eſtabliſheth a faction: for it is natural for mankind to deſire to be at eaſe, and to wiſh, and (upon occaſion) to endeavour its redreſs and relief from any grievance; and it is as natural for ſuch as reap benefit from the depreſſion of others, to ſtrive to continue them in that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed condition: from hence ariſeth anger, hatred, malice, and all uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuch contention as deſtroys a State. <hi>If a Kingdom be divided, how can it ſtand?</hi> as all things different are not oppoſite: no more is all diſtinction a factious diviſion, and deſtructive to the being of a Government. All you make up one Parliament: perſonal quarrels may ruine you, but perſonal diſtinctions will not. Contraries mutually expel each other out of the ſame ſubject by courſe of nature; things diſparate do not.</p>
            <p>Since therefore a Popiſh Inquiſition is barbarous and odious; ſubſcribing to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral forms and opinions dangerous, and ineffectual; uniting mens minds into one religion impoſſible; and no liberty granted upon penalties: What other way is left us to unite, but to allow each Church its ſeveral way of worſhip? which kind uſage with moderate endeavours, and not impoſing general opinions, may in time (as it was of old) ſo far prevail with them to reconcile the differences among themſelves, that at laſt they may arrive to a mutual communion, tho' not an exact Uniformity. Thus the <hi>Millenaries</hi> of old, and <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> men communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the other <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> and ſo it was with Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> and the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Thus the baptized <hi>Christians</hi> and the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> (*) made up one Church: Thus the Judaiſing <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> communicated together; So did the <hi>Arrians</hi>

               </note> each Church its ſeveral way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they maintaining their Miniſters: all reproachful language, and odious conſequences impoſed upon each party, as well as odious names, being prohibited: as were the names of <hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> by Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> This courſe hath ſucceeded well, for under it Religion grew: and whilſt Religion was no mans Intereſt, it was ſcarce any mans Hypocriſie: When truth had no other recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations but its naked ſelf, ſuch as imbraced it did it cordially. Nor was it ever demonſtrated or can be, that the uſe of this Liberty did directly and neceſſarily introduce ſuch Factions as are inconſiſtent with any Government or Monarchy And if it were only the abuſe of it, let us look to that; ſince the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſo often inculcates to us, that <hi>propter abuſum non eſt tollendus uſus;</hi> for that were like the forbidding (x) the <hi>Scythians</hi> to plant Wine, becauſe Wine might make them drunk. To conclude all therefore, let us in our Law be as tender of Mens Conſciences, as our Common Law is of their lives; which takes care rather that a thouſand Criminals ſhould eſcape, than one innocent be deſtroyed.</p>
